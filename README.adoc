== A five-node modulator circuit

George Spencer-Brown <<SB>>[p.68] and Luis H. Kauffman <<LK>>[pp. 121--123]
have demonstrated six-node modulators, and the question arises whether that
could be reduced further.

Figure 1 depicts a sequential logic circuit where each node is a NOR gate.

Input *_A_* is a wave of alternating 1s and 0s (true and false values under
the usual interpretation).  The output appears at node *_m3_* as a doubling of
the input's wavelength (or halving of its frequency), hence the "modulator"
designation.  For example, an input of 1010... will produce outputs such as
11001100... or 10011001..., depending on the phase shift.

Node values are propagated in sequence from earlier to later nodes,
beginning with *_m0_*.  Where a node's value depends on nodes that are later
in the sequence, we interpret that as requiring the _previous_ values of those
nodes.  Consequently, we need to assign initial values to *_m1_*, *_m2_*,
*_m3_*, and *_m4_* before the modulator begins to run.

The following table shows one such assignment in column *t~0~* (time zero).
Notice that column *t~5~* is a repeat of *t~1~*, demonstrating that columns
*t~1~* through *t~4~* (inclusive) will repeat indefinitely.

| m4 | (m0,m1,m2) | _1_ | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1

The next example shows an input of 111000..., where *t~13~* is a repeat of *t~1~*
(a valid repeat must occur at the _same point of the input wave's cycle_).
